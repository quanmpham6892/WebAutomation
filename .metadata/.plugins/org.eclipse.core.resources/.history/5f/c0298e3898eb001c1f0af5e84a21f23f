			//extends keyword allow you to inherit from parent class
		//Parent is known as the "Super" class; the child is the "Sub" class
		//In inheritance rule, your sub class to the super class; meaning the child cannot say I'm going to inherit from multiple parents

		//NOTE: We cannot do a circle inherit chain in coding; Example: A extends B, B extends C, C cannot extends B.... This would create a circle 

		C1();

		//"this" keyword is used in "constructor" chaining
			//"this" keyword can just be used once. "this" keyword can only be use in a NON-STATIC environment
